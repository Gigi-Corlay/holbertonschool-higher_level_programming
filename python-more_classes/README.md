# 🐍 More Classes and Objects

## 📖 Description

This project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**.  
It covers creating and using **classes and objects**, attributes, methods, properties, and understanding **data encapsulation** and **information hiding**.  

You will learn how to structure your Python code in an **OOP Pythonic way**, while understanding the differences between class and instance attributes, special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and how to use class and static methods effectively.
