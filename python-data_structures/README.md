# Python - Data Structures

## 📚 Description

This project, **python-data_structures**, aims to introduce and master the fundamental **data structures** in Python, mainly **lists** and **tuples**. It helps learners understand how these structures work, their differences, and the common operations associated with them.

This project is part of a progressive learning path in Python, with a strong focus on writing clean, readable, and well-structured code following best practices.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand what a data structure is
* Manipulate **lists** in Python
* Understand **tuples** and their specific characteristics
* Access, modify, and iterate over data structures
