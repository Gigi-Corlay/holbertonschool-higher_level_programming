# 🐍 Python - More Data Structures: Set & Dictionary

## 📖 Description

This project explores **advanced Python data structures** and **functional programming tools**.  
By completing it, you will master **sets**, **dictionaries**, and functional programming features such as **lambda functions**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General Python Knowledge
- 🌟 Why Python programming is awesome.
- 🔧 The difference between **sets**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**.
- ⚡ When to use sets instead of lists.
- 🔑 What a key is in a dictionary and how to access values.
- 🔄 How to iterate over sets and dictionaries.

### Sets
- Create sets: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
- Common methods:
  - `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`
  - `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`
- ✅ Efficient for checking membership and removing duplicates.

### Dictionaries
- Create dictionaries: `my_dict = {'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}`
- Access values by key: `my_dict['name']` or `my_dict.get('name')`
- Iterate over keys, values, and items:
  ```python
  for key, value in my_dict.items():
      print(key, value)
