## Basic Concepts
In Python, a class that inherits from another class is called a **child class** or **subclass**, while the class being inherited from is called a **parent class** or **superclass**.

Syntax:
```python
class ParentClass:
    # parent class code

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # child class code

## Types of Inheritance

Python supports several types of inheritance:

- **Single Inheritance:** A child class inherits from one parent class.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a child class, forming a chain.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance:** A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
